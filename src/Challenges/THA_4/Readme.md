# Challenge Requirements
### Submit all your answers to each problem below in one .doc file.
1. Suppose an initially empty stack S has performed a total of 25 push 
operations, 12 peek operations, and 10 pop operations, 3 of which returned 
null to indicate an empty stack. What is the current size of S? Explain your 
answer.
2. What values are returned during the following series of stack operations, if 
executed upon an initially empty stack? Push(5), push(3), pop(),push(2), 
push(8),pop(),pop(), push(9), push(1),pop(), push(7), push(6), pop(), pop(), 
push(4), pop(), pop(). Explain your answer.
3. Give a recursive method for removing all the elements from a stack. Write a 
method.
4. What values are retuned during the following sequence of queue operations, 
if executed on an initially empty queue? enqueue(5),enqueue(3), 
dequeue(),enqueue(2), enqueue(8), dequeue(), 
dequeue(),enqueue(9),enqueue(1),dequeue(),enqueue(7), enqueue(6),
dequeue(),dequeue(),enqueue(4), dequeue(),dequeue().
5. In code fragment 6.8 from the textbook, we assume that opening tags in 
HTML have form <name>, as with <li>. More generally, HTML allows optional 
attributes to be expressed as part of an opening tag. The general form used 
for expressing an attribute is <name attribute1=”value1” 
attribute2=”values”>; for example, a table can be given a border and 
additional padding by using an opening tag of <table border=”3” 
cellpadding=”5”>. Modify Code Fragment 6.8 so that it can properly match 
tags, even when an opening tag may include one or more such attributes,
